# PestoLink-Receive
*v1.0.0*

PestoLink-Receive is an Arduino library designed to run on a microcontroller unit (MCU) with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), for example ESP32. If you set up an MCU with PestoLink-Receive, you can then open the web app [PestoLink-Online](https://github.com/AlfredoSystems/PestoLink-Online), connect to your MCU with BLE, and send gamepad data to the MCU.

This WIP library is a BLE alternitive to [AlfredoConnect-Receive](https://github.com/AlfredoElectronics/AlfredoConnect-Receive)
